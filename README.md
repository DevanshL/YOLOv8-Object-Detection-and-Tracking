# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-and-Tracking
This project is a real-time object detection and tracking application using YOLOv8 pre-trained model built with This repository showcases an extensive open-source project that integrates real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, with Streamlit, a powerful Python web application framework. This project provides an intuitive and customizable interface that allows users to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from various sources such as  UDP, YouTube URLs, as well as static videos and images.
